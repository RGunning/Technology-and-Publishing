	abstract = {Licensing, Censorship and Authorship in Early Modern England examines in detail both how the practice of censorship shaped writing in the Shakespearean period, and how our sense of that censorship continues to shape modern understandings of what was written. Separate chapters trace the development of licensing in the theatre, and the response of the actors and dramatists to it. There are detailed examinations of how censorship affects our reading of four major playwrights: Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson and Middleton, and of how the control of printed books compared with that of the stage.},

	abstract = {China and the Internet: Politics of the Digital Leap Forward is a comprehensive assessment of the political and economic impact of information and communication technologies ({ITCs}) on Chinese society. It provides in depth analyses of topics including economic development, civil and political liberties, bureaucratic politics, international relations and security studies. The book covers the aspirations of Chinese policy-makers using the Internet to achieve a 'digital leapfrog' of economic development. After looking at the achievements made so far putting China online, the author's consider prospects for realising this digital leapfrog from a number of perspectives, including the nature of the one-party state, the lack of visible legal structure, the digital divide within China, and the problem of bureaucratic turf wars and the technological time lag behind the advanced industrial economies. The chapters also explore normative issues such as the state's ability to maintain control over the flow of information and to stifle political dissent, the impact of the Internet on the formation of national and regional identity and the impact of {ITCs} on international security.; The authors explore methodological and theoretical problems throughout, from the reliability of data to the nature of the relationship between technological and social change. Avoiding technical jargon, the book is accessible to anyone interested in the social impact of the Internet and information and communication technologies, from those in academia to business and public policy-makers.},

Jacobs's interactions with his students and the readers of his own books, however, suggest that many readers lack confidence; they wonder whether they are reading well, with proper focus and attentiveness, with due discretion and discernment. Jacobs offers an insightful, accessible, and playfully irreverent guide for aspiring readers. Each chapter focuses on one aspect of approaching literary fiction, poetry, or nonfiction, and the book explores everything from the invention of silent reading, reading responsively, rereading, and reading on electronic devices.},

What was the 'scribal art' of the time? What was the role of bookshops and libraries? What control did an author have over his creation? How were new books received and used by readers? To answer these questions Roman publishing is placed firmly in the context of a society.},

	abstract = {From an interdisciplinary approach, the neurosciences ({NSs}) represent the junction of many fields (biology, chemistry, medicine, computer science, and psychology) and aim to explore the structural and functional aspects of the nervous system. Among modern neurophysiological methods that measure different processes of the human brain to salience stimuli, a special place belongs to eye tracking ({ET}). By detecting eye position, gaze direction, sequence of eye movement and visual adaptation during cognitive activities, {ET} is an effective tool for experimental psychology and neurological research. It provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gaze, which is very useful in understanding choice behavior and perceptual decision making. In the high tech era, {ET} has several applications related to the interaction between humans and computers. Herein, {ET} is used to evaluate the spatial orienting of attention, the performance in visual tasks, the reactions to information on websites, the customer response to advertising, and the emotional and cognitive impact of various spurs to the brain.},

This study examined the impact of grasp on handwriting speed and legibility. {METHOD}: We videotaped 120 typically developing fourth-grade students while they performed a writing task. We categorized the grasps they used and evaluated their writing for speed and legibility using a handwriting assessment. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the relationship between grasp and handwriting. {RESULTS}: We documented six categories of pencil grasp: four mature grasp patterns, one immature grasp pattern, and one alternating grasp pattern. Multiple linear regression results revealed no significant effect for mature grasp on either legibility or speed. {CONCLUSION}: Pencil grasp patterns did not influence handwriting speed or legibility in this sample of typically developing children. This finding adds to the mounting body of evidence that alternative grasps may be acceptable for fast and legible handwriting.},

In fact, says Ann Blair in this intriguing book, the invention of the printing press and the ensuing abundance of books provoked sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European scholars to register complaints very similar to our own. The author examines methods of information management in ancient and medieval Europe as well as the Islamic world and China, then focuses particular attention on the organization, composition, and reception of Latin reference books in print in early modern Europe. She explores in detail the sophisticated and sometimes idiosyncratic techniques that scholars and readers developed in an era of new technology and exploding information.},
